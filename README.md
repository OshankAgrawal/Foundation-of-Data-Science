In this repository i am uploading many **Google Colab** notebooks. In which various types of **data representation method** are discussed.
Inside each file i am trying to write all the necessary detail about the different functions which is used.
**Google Colab** notebook direct link is also provided with each file but before access that file in colab software you have to need permission for which you can freely send me the request than after you can access that.
